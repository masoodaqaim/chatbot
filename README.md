# Building an AI chatbot for practice

Still working on this.
- 7/28: built the jsonfile and coded the outline (pseudocode)
- 7/28: built the network. having troubles loading data into network. shape of data is out of bound?
- 8/3: corrected error. trained the network. 98% accuracy

What still needs to be done:
- building the user input interface 


Learning how to build an AI chatbot from scratch using neural networks. This chatbot will be trained for resturant use. A few examples of how it will/should respond:
- user: "I like to buy something"
- bot: "We sell cupcakes for $4!"

- user: "What is your name?"
- bot: "I'm cupcake bot!"


See code for any mistakes and how it was corrected it.
